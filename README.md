# Converse shoe website.

This is the code for a basic beginner level website which has basic functions such as a functional nav-bar, a few tabs to navigate etc using a vue component in java.
This website was used as a template to sell shoes in different colours and a range of prices. This website has a fully fucntional cart that can have items added and removed. It will also calculate the prices of all things currenlty in the cart. If an itme is removed the item will be returned and the stock of that product will be updated accordingly.

The review section is also functional and will add the users name and review into the reviews tab once it has been submitted.
